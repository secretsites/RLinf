Example Gallery
===============

This section presents the collection of **examples currently supported by RLinf**, 
showcasing how the framework can be applied across different scenarios and 
demonstrating its efficiency in practice.

At present, we provide two major categories of examples:

- **Embodied Agent Scenario**: Training **VLA** models for embodied intelligence.  
  See :doc:`embodied`.
- **Reasoner Scenario**: Training **LLM** models for advanced reasoning tasks.  
  See :doc:`reasoning`.

The example gallery will continue to expand with new scenarios and tasks over time, 
illustrating the versatility and scalability of RLinf.
